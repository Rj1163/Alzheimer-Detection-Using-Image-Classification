# Detection of Alzheimer
Description:
The Alzheimer's Disease Image Classifier is a machine learning project aimed at assisting in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on brain MRI images. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, causing cognitive decline and memory loss. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective management and treatment of the disease.

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify brain MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's disease. The classifier is trained on a dataset containing images from individuals with varying degrees of cognitive impairment, ranging from non-demented to moderate demented.

Key Features:

Image classification into four stages: Non-demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented.
Utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.
Integration with TensorFlow and Keras for model development and training.
Streamlit web application for easy image classification and visualization of results.

Purpose:
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a tool for healthcare professionals to assist in the early diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease. By accurately classifying brain MRI images, the classifier can help identify individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease and facilitate timely interventions and treatment strategies.

Target Audience:

Healthcare professionals specializing in neurology, radiology, and geriatrics.
Researchers and scientists working in the field of Alzheimer's disease and neuroimaging.
Patients and caregivers interested in understanding and monitoring the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Future Enhancements:

Integration of additional imaging modalities, such as PET scans and fMRI, for improved diagnosis and characterization of Alzheimer's disease.
Deployment of the classifier as a web-based application accessible to a wider audience.
Continuous refinement and optimization of the classification model based on feedback and new research findings.
